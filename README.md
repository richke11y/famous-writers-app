# FAMOUS WRITERS APP

I'm teaching myself native app development and I thought starting with React Native would be a great place to begin.  To facilitate the learning process I'm building this super basic app, where I'll list a bunch of my favourite / famous writers, with the aim of display some information about them, a biography and bibliography.

I'm going to try and document the process as best I can, step by step as I learn and put into practice.
